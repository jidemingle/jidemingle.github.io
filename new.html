                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>The “Car sales Dashboard” Project is a Power BI visual analytics tool designed to leverage data-driven insights to optimize car sales strategies and enhance business performance
                        by identifying trends, patterns, and key factors influencing sales. By analyzing historical sales data,
                        market trends, and customer preferences, this project aims to Identify key factors
                        influencing car sales by determine the most significant variables
                        impacting sales volume, such as price, features, and geographic location. The analysis also serves to optimize pricing strategies by develop data-driven pricing models to maximize revenue
                        while maintaining market competitiveness.</p>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Power BI <br>DAX <br>Flaticon <br></p>
                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p>The total incidence and mortality numbers have been increasing over the years, indicating a growing burden on NHS Lothian healthcare system. <br>
                        This upward trend has the potential to strain resources and capacity, highlighting the need for proactive measures to meet the rising demand for cancer care services. <br>

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p><b>Data Granularity:</b> While the provided data enables a broad assessment, there may be limitations regarding the granularity of information available for individual properties. Deeper insights might require more detailed data, including age, exact location, and historical energy consumption patterns.<br>
                        <b>Geographic Scope:</b> As with any historical analysis, the accuracy and consistency of data can vary and may present challenges.</p>
                    <h3>Data Source</h3>
                    <p>The data utilized for this analysis was sourced from the comprehensive database available at <a href="https://statistics.gov.scot/data/domestic-energy-performance-certificates"><b>Statistics Gov Scotland</b></a>, which provides a wealth of information on domestic energy performance across Scotland. This reliable and government-maintained database ensures the integrity and credibility of the analysis.</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This Power BI project not only sheds light on the current energy efficiency ratings of domestic properties in Aberdeen and Edinburgh but also highlights the crucial areas where efforts must be concentrated. By addressing the identified limitations and continuously updating the data, stakeholders can better track progress and adapt strategies to meet energy performance targets effectively.</p>
                    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                    <p><b>Energy Efficiency Improvements:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement targeted retrofit programs focusing on insulation, double glazing, and efficient heating systems, especially for properties rated D and below.</li>
                            <li>Offer incentives for property owners in Aberdeen and Edinburgh to undertake energy efficiency improvements, such as tax rebates or grants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Renewable Energy Transition:</b>
