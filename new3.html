                    <h3>PROJECT SUMMARY</h3>
                    <p>The Call Centre project is a well-designed visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) of a call center that provides a wealth of insights into the operational efficiency and customer satisfaction that help the business understands the effectiveness of their customer service operations.</p>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Power BI <br>DAX</p>
                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p><b>Call Patterns: </b>The dashboard shows the call volume patterns viz-a-viz identifying the busiest and slowest days of the week to understand how to optimize staffing levels and resource allocation. It also helps to understand the differences in call volume between weekdays and weekends, as well as variations within specific days of the week.</p>
                    <p><b>Customer Behavior: </b>The top reasons for call and the distribution of the channel visuals can be used to gain insights into customersâ€™ behaviors and the types of issues they are calling about. Insights into customer preferred channels is essential for tracking changes in channel preferences over time to understand evolving customer behavior. This is important to optimize resource allocation based on channel usage patterns to ensure efficient staffing and volume handling.</p>
                    <p><b>Operational Issues: </b>The dashboard shows us the total calls by sentiments, and from this we can use different customer sentiments to identify underlying operational issues, such as staffing shortages, system problems, or poor product/service quality. This can help conduct root cause analysis to address the underlying causes of negative sentiment and prevent recurrence. This is also vital to identify opportunities for improvement and to Identify customers with negative sentiment who may be at risk of churn.</p>
                    <h3>LIMITATIONS:</h3>
                    <p>The data utilized for this analysis was for a period of 1 month, hence , the report could not provide a broad assessment. 
                        Deeper insights might require more detailed data, including call abandon rate and average handle time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>RECCOMMENDATIONS:</h3>
                    <p><strong><b>Resource Management</b></strong><br>A low response time percentage can negatively impact customer satisfaction and lead to lost businesses. Therefore, measures like staff optimization, call routing, technology upgrades and process improvement can be implemented.
                    <p><strong><b>Operational Efficiency</b></strong><br>The average call duration should be monitored to identify bottlenecks to ensure compliance with service level agreements. Trainings should be given, and top performers should be recognized.
                        	The call response time should be compared to the industry standard to be able to reach a conclusion on how each call center is fairing and the overall call handling performance of the business.
                        	For call centers that are not meeting SLA requirements, the root causes need to be pinpointed to implement corrective actions.
                        	Strategies should be put in place to encourage and improve on the collection of CSAT scores from customers; it will help the business gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels, identify areas for improvement, and track the effectiveness of their customer service efforts.
