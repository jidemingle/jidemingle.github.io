                    <h3>BUSINESS CASE</h3>
                    <p>We are a global retail chain aiming to sustain revenue increase , optimize inventory management and enhance customer satisfaction.
                        To achieve these objectives, we need to analyze our Month-Over-Month(MOM) performance as it pertains to  sales growth,  products and regional performance. This is important to tailor our product offerings and marketing strategies accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com/jidemingle/Retail-chain-store-analysis.git"> <i class="bluehyperlink">MySQL</i></a> 
                    <br>Power BI</p>
                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p><b>Sales Performance: </b>The dashboard reveals an overall upward trend in the monthly total sales revenue and quantity ordered for the months in review, except for February which experienced a decline in sales from January. This increase in sales thus led to the MOM percentage sales growth in five of the six months in review. This growth indicates a healthy and growing business, with increasing customer demand and market traction.</p>
                    <p><b>Customer Preferences: </b>The health and beauty, and the phone and tablets categories of the business consistently contributed the most to the overall sales revenue while the home and office, and the tablet categories contributed the least to the overall sales revenue in the six months in review. This is an important insight that helps us  to optimize inventory management- to avoid stockouts or excess inventory.
                        The sales by day by hour visual showed customer behavior as it relates to shopping patterns. The heatmap shows that the hours between 7am and 10am are the busiest hours of the day. This insight is crucial for staff optimization and targeted marketing and promotion campaigns
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Regional Performances: </b>The northern and the eastern regions are the top and the least performing regions respectively with respect to contribution to the overall monthly revenue. The impressive performance of the stores located in the northern region needs to be consolidated , while the eastern region might be requiring some strategic interventions â€“ the level of market penetration needs to be assessed.</p>
                    <h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
                    <p><b>i.</b> For the six-month-period under review, there is a general upward trend in MOM sales growth, accompanied with increase in total quantity of goods sold. The business needs to sustains this trend by replicating its success strategies.  However, for a more holistic data analysis, additional data, if available, needs to be included in the analysis to look at the YOY parameters of the business to understand how sales fluctuate throughout the year and adjust strategies accordingly.
                         <br><b> ii.</b> For products and product categories with  low sales return, there is a need to investigate the categories of products whose prices could be  adjusted to improve sales, and a need to further understand which customer segment prefer specific product categories.
                        <br> <b>iii.</b> For the under-performing eastern region, there are several strategic interventions that could be implemented to drive up sales.  I strongly recommend an adaptable and localized marketing strategy tailored to resonate with local preferences and culture. Also, the sales force needs to be enhanced and the product offering optimized.
                        However, a preliminary thorough root cause analysis needs to be conducted to know which strategy will be most effective. 
                        <br><b>iv.</b> There is a need to continuously monitor key performance indicators like sales revenue, market share, and customer satisfaction and be willing to adapt strategies based on the evolving market conditions and customer needs.
                        </p>
                    <!-- <h3>RECCOMMENDATIONS:</h3>
                    <p><strong><b>Resource Management</b></strong><br>A low response time percentage can negatively impact customer satisfaction and lead to lost businesses. Therefore, measures like staff optimization, call routing, technology upgrades and process improvement can be implemented.
                    <p><strong><b>Operational Efficiency</b></strong><br>The average call duration should be monitored to identify bottlenecks to ensure compliance with service level agreements. Trainings should be given, and top performers should be recognized.
                        	The call response time should be compared to the industry standard to be able to reach a conclusion on how each call center is fairing and the overall call handling performance of the business.
                        	For call centers that are not meeting SLA requirements, the root causes need to be pinpointed to implement corrective actions.
                        	Strategies should be put in place to encourage and improve on the collection of CSAT scores from customers; it will help the business gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels, identify areas for improvement, and track the effectiveness of their customer service efforts. -->
